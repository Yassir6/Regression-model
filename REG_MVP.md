**This two graphs show th between features and target**. 

####  when we got the dataset we did some of EDA such as Cleaning, Change the type of some columns, drop nulls and drop some outliers.Then we chose our target to be (Price) and our features(area ,number of bedrooms,bathrooms,halls...etc) and we made this two graphs that shows correlation between features and target.We have  found some positive correlation between price , area, bathrooms, and bedrooms and there is negative correlation between real estate age and price.

#### Next Step:
